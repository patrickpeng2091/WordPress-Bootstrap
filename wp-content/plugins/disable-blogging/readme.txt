Disable posts, comments, feeds, and other related the blogging features. A must have plugin to turn WordPress into a non-blogging CMS platform.

== Description ==
> Turn WordPress into a non-blogging CMS platform. **Disable Blogging** is a plugin that disables all blog related functionalities (posts, comments, feeds, etc.) on the front-end and back-end. This results in a cleaner and simpler WordPress platform to be used for static websites.

= Disable all posting & comments functions =
At its core level, all posting and comment related functionalities are disabled - but that's not all. **Disable Blogging** includes 20+ additional features to disable and hide cumbersome functions that run on WordPress including:

* Disable [Author](https://codex.wordpress.org/Author_Templates#Introduction) pages
* Disable [feeds](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Feeds#Introduction_to_Feeds), [pingbacks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Pingback), [trackbacks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Trackback), and [XML-RPC](https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support)
* Remove [Screen Options](http://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/screen-options) and [Help](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Screen/add_help_tab#Description) tabs from the admin header
* Remove the admin bar greeting next to the username
* Remove query strings from CSS & JS files
* Remove extra code from the header for [emoji support](https://codex.wordpress.org/Emoji)
* Simplify user profile
* [*and so much more...*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-blogging/screenshots/)

= Notice =
This plugin does not delete any data on WordPress. It simply hides and disables those features that are blog related. If you have any existing, posts, comments, categories and tags on your website; they must be manually deleted if you do not want to keep any of that information. All plugin features can be enabled or disabled in the plugin's settings (*Settings* > *Blogging*).

Links to previous posts will still be accessible and previous comments will be hidden from view.

No, this plugin simply disables, hides, and redirects all of the blogging functions. You can easily revert WordPress back to a blogging platform by simply disabling the plugin.

= How do I find the label IDs to hide additional profile fields? =
1. Navigate to the `Users` > `Your Profile`
1. Open up your browser's web inspector (ex: [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools))
1. Use the element selector and select the label on the left side of field that you want to hide, for example:
  * `<label for="first_name">First Name</label>`

  * `first_name`
