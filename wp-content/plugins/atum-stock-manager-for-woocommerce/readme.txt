== Installation ==

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWbjhEv_nKM

**From your WordPress dashboard**

1.  Visit `Plugins > Add New`.
2.  Search for 'ATUM Inventory Manager for WooCommerce'.
3.  Activate ATUM from your Plugins page.

**From WordPress.org**

1.  Download ATUM.
2.  Upload the 'atum' directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, using your favourite method (FTP, SFTP, SCP, etc).
3.  Activate ATUM from your Plugins page.

**Once Activated**

Open the stock central menu and follow the message at the top of the page or activate the stock control from the `Settings > Stock Central` menu. You will not see any items in the Stock Central view unless you enable the "Manage Stock" functionality at the product level. ATUM will enable the complete stock management for you. The plugin will remember your original settings in case you decide to deactivate the plugin later. ATUM will ask you if you'd like to return to your original setting at this stage.

If you'd like to see only selected products, leave the ATUM stock control option disabled. You will need to enable/disable the stock control of each product from their product listing page (Inventory Tab).

**Once Configured**

* ATUM was designed to give the user overall control of the full WooCommerce inventory from one screen. Stock Central can be completely configured, and individual columns that are not part of the free version disabled.
* We have prepared the Stock Central help section that will guide every user through the individual column functionality.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the minimum ATUM requirements? =

ATUM requires PHP version 5.6 or greater, but our recommended environment is the same as WordPress:
[https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/).

Also, we recommend of having WooCommerce up-to-date as we test and adapt ATUM for the latest version.

= Is ATUM plugin FREE? =

ATUM inventory management plugin is completely free and will stay as such. It was designed to suit most users that need basic inventory control of their business. However, for users that wish to take their control further have the opportunity of using one of our add-ons.

= How do I control/see only selected products in Stock Central? =

To control and view only selected products in Stock Central, disable the stock control option in `Settings > Stock Central`. You will then need to enable the stock control at product level option for each product you want to see in Stock Central individually. ATUM needs to manage products at the product level to display them in Stock Central.

= Can I quickly change the stock amount for individual products? =

Yes, after the 1.1.2 update you can. Click the stock amount of the relevant product under the "Current Stock" column. ATUM opens a little pop-up, where you can apply your change. Now you can do many changes at the same time and hit the save button that appears on the top left.

= I have a problem, who do I contact and how? =

Please, in case of a sensitive issue open an official [support ticket](https://stockmanagementlabs.ticksy.com/) or if it is a simple bug, leave a post in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/atum-stock-manager-for-woocommerce). Alternatively, send us a message on Skype or Facebook (user: "stockmanagementlabs").

= Is the ATUM plugin available in different languages? =

At present the only language available is English, but we are hoping for several translations. If you are interested in working with us and translate the plugin, don't hesitate and do it [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/atum-stock-manager-for-woocommerce). We will reward you big time!

= Does ATUM Inventory manager for WooCommerce display all product types? =

From the 1.1.0 update of ATUM inventory manager for WooCommerce, we support all types of products.

= Does Stock Central support product variations? =

Product variations are fully supported and editable from Stock Central. ATUM handles variable products with ease and uses an expandable feature to make things clear and straightforward.

= I have updated the ATUM plugin to the last version, and I can't see the new functionality =

If you are using some cache system, try to purge the cache or ask your hosting provider to do it.
Also, try to reload the ATUM pages with CTRL + F5 (Windows) or CMD + R (MacOs) to clear your browser cache.

= The plugin won't work < PHP 5.6 =

We are very sorry, but the current version of the plugin needs PHP 5.6+. Our team has tested it on PHP7 that is recommended by WordPress. Please, see the link here https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/

We do not plan any support for older PHP and version 5.6 is the minimum.

= How/when can I get the pro version? And how much is it? =

We released the core version of ATUM in January 2017, and the team is now working hard to improve the free version. We want ATUM inventory manager for WooCommerce to be the strongest plugin out there. In the free release as well as the Premium add-ons. You can check the progress of these add-ons on our website. The only thing we can say right now is that ATUM will never be user restricted and everyone in your company will be able to use it. No need to pay per user licenses or spend big money to use the plugin.

= I see that you will be adding a warehouse feature. Do you know when this will be and how much that version will cost? =

We are glad to confirm that locations of storage such as warehouses will be a part of the free version. As of August September 2017, we have started to work on this feature including locations zones, etc.

= I have all of the variations with the correct inventory quantities and see the green check mark 'in stock' when I display the variations. However, the product still shows 'Out of Stock' in the store. =

WooCommerce stock instances are something we have already tackled. Please, watch the videos below to see all the steps to help you out.
